# 🌿 Vegetation Analysis Integration

CoolCity Planner now integrates **dual vegetation analysis** from two complementary sources to provide comprehensive green coverage assessment for urban heat island analysis.

## 🎯 Dual Vegetation Analysis System

### 1. **TwelveLabs Visual Analysis** 📹
- **Source**: AI-powered visual detection from satellite imagery  
- **Method**: Converts static satellite images to videos for TwelveLabs processing
- **Output**: Visual identification of vegetation areas, parks, trees
- **Strengths**: Excellent at detecting visual vegetation features and urban green spaces

### 2. **NASA Satellite Data** 🛰️  
- **Source**: Real NASA MODIS satellite data via API endpoints
- **Method**: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis
- **Output**: Quantitative vegetation health and coverage percentage
- **Strengths**: Precise vegetation health metrics and scientific accuracy

## 🔍 Real NASA API Integration

### Primary Endpoint: MODIS NDVI API
```python
# NASA MODIS Vegetation Indices (MOD13A1)
url = "https://modis.ornl.gov/rst/api/v1/MOD13A1/subset"
# 16-day composite at 500m resolution
```

### Fallback Endpoint: NASA EarthData
```python  
# NASA AppEEARS EarthData Cloud
url = "https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/api/point"
# Higher resolution (250m) MODIS data
```

## 📊 NDVI Scale & Interpretation

| NDVI Range | Vegetation Health | Coverage % | Description |
|------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| 0.8 - 1.0  | Excellent        | 80-100%    | Dense, healthy forests |
| 0.6 - 0.8  | Good             | 60-80%     | Healthy vegetation |
| 0.4 - 0.6  | Moderate         | 40-60%     | Mixed vegetation |
| 0.2 - 0.4  | Poor             | 20-40%     | Sparse vegetation |
| 0.0 - 0.2  | Very Poor        | 0-20%      | Very sparse/stressed |
| < 0.0      | None             | 0%         | Water/urban/bare soil |

## 🏙️ Integration in Heat Island Analysis

### Enhanced Heat Island Calculation
```python
intensity = (
    temperature_factor * 0.25 +    # Current weather (OpenWeather)
    surface_factor * 0.30 +        # Urban surfaces (TwelveLabs)  
    vegetation_factor * 0.15 +     # Visual vegetation (TwelveLabs)
    ndvi_factor * 0.10 +          # Vegetation health (NASA NDVI)
    coverage_factor * 0.10 +       # Coverage percentage (NASA)
    temp_factor * 0.10            # Land temperature (NASA)
)
```

### Key Benefits:
- **🎯 Dual Validation**: Cross-validates vegetation detection
- **📈 Quantitative Metrics**: Precise coverage percentages
- **🌡️ Heat Impact**: Better correlates vegetation to cooling effect  
- **💡 Smart Recommendations**: Targeted solutions based on coverage gaps

## 🛠️ API Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for real NASA data
NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_api_key_here

# NASA API key from: https://api.nasa.gov/
# Free tier available with registration
```

### Mock Data Fallback
- High-quality mock data when API key unavailable
- Realistic NDVI values based on geographic location
- Consistent for development and testing

## 🧪 Testing

Run vegetation analysis tests:
```bash
cd backend
python test_nasa_vegetation.py
```

### Test Locations:
- **Central Park, NYC**: High vegetation (NDVI ~0.7)
- **Times Square, NYC**: Urban area (NDVI ~0.1)  
- **Amazon Rainforest**: Dense vegetation (NDVI ~0.9)
- **Sahara Desert**: No vegetation (NDVI ~-0.1)
